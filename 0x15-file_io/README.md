File I/O in C
This is a simple project that demonstrates file input and output operations in the C programming language. It includes sample code for reading and writing text files using standard C library functions such as fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), fclose(), etc.

Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you'll need to have a C compiler like (Git Bash). You can then clone the repository and compile the source code using your preferred method.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-io-c.git
cd file-io-c
gcc -o file-io file-io.c
./file-io


Usage
Once you've compiled and run the program, you'll be prompted to enter the name of a text file to read from or write to. You can then follow the on-screen instructions to read or write the file, depending on your choice. The program supports reading and writing files in both binary and text modes.
