Welcome to my  project on Linked Lists in C Language!

This project aims to provide an introduction to linked lists, one of the most commonly used data structures in computer science. Linked lists are used to store and manage collections of data that can grow or shrink dynamically, making them a versatile and powerful tool for many applications.

In this project, I have implemented basic operations on linked lists such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.I have also included examples of how to use linked lists to solve common programming problems.

My implementation is written in C language, a powerful and efficient programming language that is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and other applications that require high performance and low-level access to hardware.

To get started with your project, you can clone the repository and compile the source code. The project is well-documented and includes examples of how to use the linked list implementation in your own programs.

We hope that this project will be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about linked lists and how to use them in C language. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
