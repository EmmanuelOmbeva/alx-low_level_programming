Bit Manipulation in C
This project explores the concept of bit manipulation in the C programming language. Bit manipulation involves performing operations on individual bits within a binary number, and it can be used to perform complex operations in a very efficient way.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have a working knowledge of C programming, as well as some understanding of binary numbers and bitwise operators. You'll also need a C compiler, such as GCC or Clang.

Usage
The project includes several example programs that demonstrate various techniques for bit manipulation. To run an example program, simply compile the source code and then run the resulting executable file.

Here's an example of how to compile and run the bitcount.c program on a Unix-based system:

Sure, here's an example README.md file for a project on Bit Manipulation in C language:

Copy code
$ gcc bitcount.c -o bitcount
$ ./bitcount
Examples
The project includes the following example programs:

bitcount.c: Calculates the number of bits set to 1 in an integer.
bitrotate.c: Rotates the bits in an integer left or right by a specified number of positions.
bitset.c: Sets a particular bit in an integer to 1.
bitclear.c: Clears a particular bit in an integer (sets it to 0).
bitflip.c: Flips the value of a particular bit in an integer (changes 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).
bitmask.c: Applies a mask to an integer to set or clear particular bits.
